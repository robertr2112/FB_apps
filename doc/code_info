Managing Datetime 
  - adding number of days to a datetime.
    * Time.now + 5.days (or months, weeks, years)

Determining the day of the week
  - today = Time.now
  - today.wday (displays day number, ie: 2 for Tuesday)

Determining next Sunday of week
  - today = Time.now
  - sunday = today + (7 - today.wday).days

Set a certain date/time
  - day = Time.local(2016, 11, 10, 12, 00)
      * Returns day = Thu, 10 Nov 2016 12:00:00 -0600

Printing Datetime
  - today = Time.now
  - today.strftime(%A %B %d %Z) 
     * displays "Tuesday October 11"
     * use today.day.ordinalize for 3rd, 4th, etc, so you could do
       today.strftime("%A %B ") + today.day.ordinalize
     * displays "Tuesday October 11th"

Capybara Info

  - If you are trying to test the attribute values you would do
    
      have_selector('input[id="email"][placeholder="Email"]')
    
    or better yet since you're using CSS

      have_css('input[id="email"][placeholder="Email"]')
     
    or you could use Capybaras built-in :field selector type and do

      have_field(id: 'email', placeholder: 'Email')
