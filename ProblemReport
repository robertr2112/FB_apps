1) Pools aren't deleted when owner of pool is deleted.  Need to figure
   out a way to get the pools to be deleted.  Maybe an after_delete method.

2) The find() methods return an unrecoverable error when record not found.  Need 
   to either figure out how to use the rescue_from function or rewrite code to
   use find_by_id() and check for NULL fields.

3) Fix main page header and footer to be FB_app specific.(DONE!)

4) Add a pool/new link somewhere on main page.

5) Update Week/Game models to validate the parent Id's are present.

6) Change the tests for testing parent Id is set properly using the its
   method as shown in chapter 10.

7) Change the confirm and password_reset emails to not send the encrypted token.
   Instead send the unencrypted token and convert it in the code.

8) Add all of the testing needed to test the password_reset, remember_me, and
   user_confirmations.
