GENERAL ISSUES
--------------

1) Add testing to test out entire application

CRITICAL ISSUES
---------------
1) Sass-rails is being deprecated.  Need to use sassc-rails instead.  See 
   the following documentation:
       http://sass.logdown.com/posts/7081811
       https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

PROBLEMS
--------

1) Pools aren't deleted when owner of pool is deleted.  Need to figure
   out a way to get the pools to be deleted.  Maybe an after_delete method.

2) The find() methods return an unrecoverable error when record not found.  Need 
   to either figure out how to use the rescue_from function or rewrite code to
   use find_by_id() and check for NULL fields.

3) Change the confirm and password_reset emails to not send the encrypted token.
   Instead send the unencrypted token and convert it in the code.

4) Add a admin page to add additional admin users

5) GamePick model contains unnecessary attribute game_pick_id

6) Need to change the routine name in Pick model from buildSelectTeams to       
   buildAvailTeams.

TESTING ISSUES
--------------
1) Need to test for case of pool not updating before starting_week is final

2) Add all of the testing needed to test the password_reset, remember_me, and
   user_confirmations emails.

3) Change the tests for testing parent Id is set properly using the its
   method as shown in chapter 10.
   
4) Change use from FactoryGirl to FactoryBot gem.  It's the same gem with a name change.    
   look into using FactoryGirlRails gem for auto-generating factories.
   
5) Add using Guard and Spring(or Spork?) to speed up tests.


DESIGN CHANGES
--------------

1) Change default behaviour for forgetting to pick to pick home team from last game.

2) Add flag to determine what to do with all users getting knocked out at same time 
   during a non-last week.  Option A, they all win.  Option B, they all get reinstated
   and pool goes on.
